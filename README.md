README
Just about every person who has grown up in Hawaii has gone camping on the beach as a kid 
and gone crab hunting at night. In this game, the roles are reversed! Venture through the 
night trying to forage for food and set a high score, but avoid flashlight spots from kids 
looking to catch you! If you get spotted, you'll quickly learn that there is no place like home. 
Or in this case, there's no place like hole.

OBJECTIVE:
Collect as many bioluminescent plankton as you can without getting caught. From the moment you 
emerge from your hole, there are several flashlight spots looking for you. If you get spotted, 
you will have to run back down to your home for safety.

If you make it back safely to your hole, you have another chance to wander the beach and rack 
up more points, but if you get caught in a net, you lose.

See how high you can score!

HOW TO RUN:
* Run “npm install” to install all dependencies
